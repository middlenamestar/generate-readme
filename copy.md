something the book has really made clear to me already is that the fundamental conflict at the heart of the us political project between the class of southern-based land-owning whites wanting “a nation for the white race” based around domestic capitalism and self sufficiency and the ideals of an independent Republic where if you’re a white guy you can literally do whatever you want

VS the more northern land-owning whites wanting to do their own version of the british or roman empires spanning the globe based around a meritocratic and cosmopolitan oligarchy is both as old as the country and still the core issue in american politics. how much of us history is these two groups fighting each other but when faced with anything that threatens their shared, base ideologies (white supremacy and its father, capitalism) they work together and how whenever you hear the words ‘partisan’ or 'bipartisan’ used in the us it’s essentially this fundamental conflict at play however obscured by language

## Usage

like whether in the form of the present republican and democratic parties or in the form of us congress and senate in the 1890s arguing about whether it was best to annex and settle aka old school imperialism or do economic imperialism thru allowing local regional sovereignty while taking ownership of their economic system aka the kind of imperialism most common now, these arguments regarding the american perpetual state’s identity crisis and what they think they should do with other regions comes down to “is this region sufficiently settled by whites and perceived to be assimilated into anglo-american culture”

## Contributing

and if yes, then they annex, if no, they take economic control while allowing the country to continue believing it is an independent sovereign nation. this was their thought process during manifest destiny and westward expansion, their thought process as they began expanding into what is now known as the greater united states or the us empire in the 1890s,

## Tests

and it remains their thought process in the present, the way these things come into action in a practical sense shift and change but us foreign policy really still comes down to this at a base level

## Credits

i’ve been listening to an audiobook copy of ‘how to hide an empire: a history of the greater united states’ by daniel immerwahr and i’m about a 1/3rd of the way through it and so far it’s been really illuminating.
