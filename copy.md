a really important part of puerto rican/us relations in this book goes into another thing i didn't know, which was the discovery of hookworm at the turn of the 20th century as the cause of what was considered to be a pervasive, endemic anemia afflicting the poor across the us south and puerto rico.

## Installation

at that time, the poorest workers in both regions did not wear/own shoes and struggled with unsanitary living/working conditions. this coupled with the hot, wet climates of the south and puerto rico lead to a situation where at many as 9/10 puerto rican j√≠baros (peasants) had chronic hookworm disease. the us doctor who discovered this, bailey k ashford, then developed a campaign to try to eradicate this disease in puerto rico using medications as well as public health measures. the puerto rican civil government (run by white anglo-americans from the mainland) only gave ashford and his team $5000 to do this which was not even close to enough, and he spent something like a decade treating thousands of people with hookworm.

## Usage

but due to underfunding and poor working conditions the whito puerto rican plantation landowners refused to improve, as well as their campaign lobbying against these public health measures and blocking the funding, ashford and the others were unable to keep treating people and those who were successfully treated just kept getting hookworm over and over and by 1930 the levels of hookworm disease were once again as bad as they'd been in 1900.

## Contributing

in contrast, ashford's mentor in the us south used his discovery to petition for a campaign to eradicate hookworm among the white poor of the south.

## Tests

his campaign received $1 million in funding from rockefeller and the support of the local state governments. this campaign eventually stretched to encompass poor black communities and by the 1970s hookworm was basically eradicated in the south. the us government declared by the 1980s that hookworm had been eradicated in the us and there was no more local transmission.

## Credits

at the same time, hookworm remained a problem for the working poor of puerto rico, a united states territory.
